1.the monotor is not comfortable and flexiable enough to operate; the connection issues; maybe need to power it fisrt to initilize the monitor;
2. Due to the battaries and everything; it is not portable;
3. The connection issues of controller and rover; sometimes it just works itself after some mins;
4. start and stop recording should be more flexible;
5. When it is getting to far of the monitor/keyboard from the car, the connection is getting bad;
6. limit the driving speed to make the lidar pointcloud useful.
7. The zed camera is not so stable, and it will tremble a little bit when driving.
8. Take care of the connection of monitor and wireless video connector(balck box), it might brake the HDMI cable;
9. when driving, follow the straight line as much as possible to make the route stable.
10. when driving straight; it slightly deviate towards left direction

11. solve the monitor issue via ssh(midnight commander); but require private wifi rather uni network.
